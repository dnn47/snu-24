# My SNU Website

[snu-24.web.app](https://snu-24.web.app/)

Welcome to my Gilman Follow-On Projectâ€”a personal blog documenting my study abroad experience at Seoul National University. Built with Vite, React, and TypeScript, and deployed via Firebase, this platform is designed to share my experiences with a global audience. To ensure accessibility regardless of language barriers, the site integrates Google Translate to provide full-page translations, making my journey accessible to as many people as possible.
