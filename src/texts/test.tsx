  `My first week in Korea was a whirlwind of emotions and experiences. I arrived not knowing the language and sharing a room with three strangers, my roommates, whom I had met just a week prior. Initially, I felt quite alone and isolated, unable to understand anything around me. However, as the week went on, I bonded with my roommates over our shared awe and confusion of Korea. This photo captures my roommates, friends, and me at the Seoul National University International Student Orientation. This marks the beginning of my adventure.`,
  `Week 2 was very busy. Every day, my roommates and I were out and about exploring different parts of Seoul. One day, we wandered into Hongdae, a lively neighborhood known for its vibrant street art, indie music scene, and trendy cafes. This photo captures a moment of me feeding some cats at a local cat cafe in Hongdae. The cat cafe filled a small void in my heart as Iâ€™ve been missing my little puppy dog back home. Feeding and petting the cats reminded me a little bit of home and brought a sense of comfort and familiarity. It was nice to find a cozy spot amidst the hustle and bustle of the city where I could relax and connect with these furry friends. I enjoy these days of aimless wandering through parts of Seoul. It allows me to truly connect with the city.`,
  `Week 3 brought a dose of reality. The first few weeks had felt like a vacation of sorts, but now classes were in full swing, and I was settling into a routine. My roommates and I slowly stopped being tourists gawking at everything and soon became like everyone else, living our mundane lives. Part of that mundane life included grocery shopping. This photo shows a Costco in Korea, where one of my roommates and I went to stock up on food. This Costco was massive, with two floors and lots of free samples. Korean Costco is similar to American Costco, but instead of bulk American-branded foods and goods, it features Korean-branded items. I like Korean Costco.`,
  `On the weekends, my friends and I would explore more of the city as a break from classes. In this photo, we visited Namsan Seoul Tower, one of Seoul's most iconic landmarks. The tower offered breathtaking panoramic views of the city with a vibrant atmosphere. We took the cable car up to the tower and wandered around the observation deck, taking in the stunning scenery. One of the highlights was writing our names on the wall among countless others left by visitors from all over the world. It felt like leaving a small piece of ourselves in Korea, a testament to our time here. I hope to return someday and find my name again.`,
  `This photo is from my extended weekend getaway to Busan, South Korea's second-largest city and a popular coastal destination. Busan is a famous city in Korea known for its beautiful beaches, vibrant nightlife, and delicious seafood. I loved it there. The seafood was so good. My favorite dish was an octopus stew with intestines called "nakji bokkeum". I still think about it from time to time. Beyond the food, the company was even better. Some friends and family joined the trip. Their presence added an extra layer of joy and excitement to the trip, allowing for shared moments of discovery, and laughter, and creating lasting memories together.`,
